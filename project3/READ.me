The project was about analazying a grocery list and counting the number of groceries on the list and then adding a feature to be able to search the grocery list and display the grocery list for the user.
I believe I did most of the project partically well especially the python code part as python to me is easy to code in. I believe my classes in my c++ could use some work because I am not sure if what I put in them is good at what they seperated. I also know of a bug where my program breaks if the user misspells a grocery item when searching so fixing that would help the program not break. I found the classes the most challenging cause I was not too sure how to break it up as I thought having one class would be bad because the one class is doing everything. I overcame this by basically brainstorming what was a way I could develope the classes in a way were multiple classes would help each other. I believe working with private fields between classes and refrecing will be partically useful in future projects. I made my code adaptable by having mutliple classes and seperating everything if one thing were to break it would not break the entire program. I also made it readable by follow code standards for c++ such camelCase and the underscores for python. I also commented my code when needed to add addition context whilist also having apropate very names for my methods.
